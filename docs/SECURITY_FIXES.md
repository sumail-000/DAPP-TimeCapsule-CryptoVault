# Security Fixes Applied - TimeCapsule Vault

## 🛡️ **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED**

### **1. ✅ REENTRANCY ATTACK PREVENTION**
**Issue**: Auto-withdrawal function was vulnerable to reentrancy attacks
**Fix**: Added `noReentrant` modifier to `_checkAndExecuteAutoWithdraw()`
```solidity
function _checkAndExecuteAutoWithdraw() internal noReentrant {
    // Protected against reentrancy during auto-withdrawal
}
```
**Impact**: Prevents attackers from draining vault funds through recursive calls

### **2. ✅ ACCESS CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION**
**Issue**: Anyone could change automation contract in VaultFactory
**Fix**: Added owner-only access control
```solidity
address public owner;
modifier onlyOwner() { require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized: only owner"); _; }
function setAutomationContract(address _contract) external onlyOwner { ... }
```
**Impact**: Only authorized users can modify critical system settings

### **3. ✅ ORACLE CIRCUIT BREAKER**
**Issue**: No protection against extreme price manipulation
**Fix**: Added price change limits and validation
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_PRICE_CHANGE = 50; // 50% max change per hour
// Circuit breaker logic prevents extreme price swings
```
**Impact**: Protects against flash loan attacks and oracle manipulation

### **4. ✅ EMERGENCY WITHDRAWAL FIX**
**Issue**: Emergency withdrawal failed when `unlockTime = 0`
**Fix**: Added contract creation timestamp
```solidity
uint256 public immutable createdAt;
uint256 emergencyTime = unlockTime > 0 ? unlockTime + 365 days : createdAt + 365 days;
```
**Impact**: Emergency withdrawal works for all vault types

## 🟡 **MEDIUM VULNERABILITIES FIXED**

### **5. ✅ GAS LIMIT PROTECTION**
**Issue**: Automation could run out of gas with too many vaults
**Fix**: Added processing limits and gas caps
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_VAULTS_PER_UPKEEP = 20;
uint256 public constant WITHDRAWAL_GAS_LIMIT = 100000;
```
**Impact**: System remains functional even with thousands of vaults

### **6. ✅ AUTOMATION ACCESS CONTROL**
**Issue**: Anyone could add/remove vaults from monitoring
**Fix**: Added authorization requirements
```solidity
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == factoryContract, "Not authorized");
    _;
}
```
**Impact**: Only authorized contracts can manage vault monitoring
